# SpatialDAO

## Introduction

To analyze planet data, you need planetary scales infrastructure. Spatial DAO aims to provide planetary scale infrastructure for data discovery, analysis, and visualization. Users can purchase data for specific regions for analysis and share the results with the community. Spatial DAO is a decentralized data marketplace for planetary scale data.

## Architecture

Spatial DAO is a decentralized data marketplace for planetary scale data. It is built on top Filecoin network using FVM/FIL+ and IPFS. Data is stored on IPFS and Filecoin web3 storage network. A react web app is used to browse for datasets, purchase access lease to datasets. The web application itself can be hosted on IPFS for a truly decentralized experience.

## Getting Started

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
